h1. Small Dijkstra example using "Neo4j":http://neo4j.org/

!http://github.com/neo4j-examples/java-dijkstra/raw/master/src/main/model/nodespace.png!


*Requirements*

To execute the project, Java 5+ is needed.


*Download packages*

There's download packages located here:
"m2.neo4j.org/...java-dijkstra...":http://m2.neo4j.org/org/neo4j/examples/java-dijkstra/1.0.0-SNAPSHOT/
Look for files ending in .zip or .tar.gz


*Contents of the download package*

| @bin/@ | start script for the application in Unix and Windows format |
| @docs/@ | javadoc of all Neo4j component dependencies of the project |
| @lib/@ | all dependency jars of the project |
| @lib/report@ | dependency report including license information |
| @src/@ | source code of the project |


*Run from download package*

Simply start the corresponding script in the @bin/@ directory. For example:
@$ ./bin/dijkstra@ 


*Run from source*

_Using JDK:_
 Use the download package and add the lib/ directory
 to the project classpath ("build path" in Eclipse).
 In this case, only JDK 1.6 is required to run the code
 from source.

_Using JDK + Maven:_
Checkout or download the source code from GitHub and use the Maven2
 setup originally used for the project. This option requires
 JDK 1.5 and Maven2 to be installed, see:  "Java Setup":http://wiki.neo4j.org/content/Java_Setup_HowTo
 With Maven2 installed, simply issue the following command
 at the command prompt:
 @$ mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.neo4j.examples.dijkstra.DijkstraExample"@
 This command will download all dependencies which are needed on the first run.
